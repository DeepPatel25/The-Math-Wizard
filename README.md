## Problem
Given youâ€™re at the Math Wizard competition. To solve formulae given to you, you decide to write an algorithm to make it easier to solve.


For the next round, the problem is given to you on paper with its answer, and you have to tell the jury whether the formula solves and matches the given answer or not! Standard BODMAS rules apply to the competition.

## Input
    T = Testcases


## Limits
    1 < T < 100 (small)
    1 < T < 1000 (large)

## Sample

### Sample Input

    2
    6 + 2 * nine / 2 equals 105
    3 + 2 = 5

## Sample Output
